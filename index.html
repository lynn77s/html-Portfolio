    <h1>My 100th Attempt</h1>
    <p>This is probably my 100th attempt at completing a HTML course. I took it at some point in my
        </br>life but as you can tell, I did not take that very seriously. In response, I could only remeber the
        </br> basics and never did comprehend making an entire website from scratch and becoming a professional
        </br>Full-Stack Developer. I have challenged myself to apply for a Developer job call next month,
        </br> and I would like to complete a good potion of this course by that time. Wish me luck.
